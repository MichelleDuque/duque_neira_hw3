## Description

The Digidevice is a Vue and Ajax project. We use an existing API to get Digimon names and levels. Then, using our own API, we retrieve the evolution and images of each Digimon.

## Features

- **Digimon Selection**: Users can choose their favourite Digimon and learn about it.
  
- **Evolution**: Users can evolve their Digimon from the Digidevice.

## Implementation

- **Vue**: Vue.js is used for the frontend development.
  
- **Ajax**: Ajax is used to make asynchronous HTTP requests to fetch data from APIs.

## Installation

No installation is required. Download the files to your desktop.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

1. **Start the Digidevice**: 

2. **Discover Your Favorite Digimon**: 

3. **Evolve Your Digimon**:
